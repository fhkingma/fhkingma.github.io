    <article>
        <p>I am a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.adyen.com/">Adyen</a>. Before that, I did a machine learning research project together with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2dkA4KwAAAAJ&hl=en">Tom Bird</a> and <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/D.Barber.html">David Barber</a> of the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/">UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence</a>. I graduated from the Erasmus University Rotterdam obtaining a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Econometrics and Management Science. The master's track I have undertaken was Operations Research &amp; Quantitative Logistics. For my master's thesis, I was advised by <a href="https://www.eur.nl/people/michel-van-de-velden">Michel van de Velden</a>. For the related research, I visited Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research lab (<a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">BAIR</a>), where I was advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>. I have a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from Delft University of Technology. For my bachelor's thesis, I was advised by both <a href="https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=2gmHmJYAAAAJ">Marco Loog</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=oHglcfAAAAAJ">Frank van der Meulen</a>. </p>
